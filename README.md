# Compiler Castle: A Hierarchical Error & Solution Tree for Kotlin

**Compiler Castle** is an open-source initiative to build a hierarchical error and solution tree for the Kotlin programming language. Our goal is to help developers of all levels understand and resolve compiler errors through structured, context-aware explanations and community-curated solutions.

## Vision

To create a world where every programmer can quickly understand and resolve compiler errors through a structured and community-driven knowledge base.

## Core Concepts

Compiler errors are not isolated; they form a hierarchy. "Compiler Castle" represents this as a tree structure where each node contains:

- A clear explanation.
- Context-aware examples.
- Pointers to parent/child errors.
- Community-contributed solutions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JDK 11 or higher
- Kotlin 1.9.x or higher
- Gradle

### Building the Project

```bash
./gradlew build
```
